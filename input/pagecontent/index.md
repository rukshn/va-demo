## Introduction

Verbal autopsy is a method of post-mortem investigation used in public health and epidemiology to determine the probable cause of death when there is no formal medical certification available. This approach involves interviewing family members, caregivers, or witnesses of a deceased individual to gather information about the signs, symptoms, and circumstances leading to the person's death. Verbal autopsies are particularly valuable in regions with limited healthcare infrastructure or where medical records are scarce.

The collected data is then analyzed by trained professionals, often using standardized questionnaires, algorithms, or computer-based tools, to estimate the likely cause of death. While not as precise as clinical autopsies conducted by pathologists, verbal autopsies provide valuable insights for understanding mortality patterns, identifying public health priorities, and informing policy decisions, especially in resource-constrained settings. This method plays a crucial role in assessing and addressing public health issues and contributing to improved health outcomes in populations with limited access to medical services.

## SMART Guidelines

SMART Guidelines â€” Standards-based, Machine-readable, Adaptive, Requirements-based, and Testable -- are a comprehensive set of reusable digital health components (e.g., interoperability standards, code libraries, algorithms, technical and operational specifications) that transform the guideline adaptation and implementation process to preserve fidelity and accelerate uptake. SMART Guidelines provide a five-step pathway to advance the adoption of best clinical and data practices, even if a country is not yet fully digital.
